# Efficient data carpentry

**Learning objectives:**

-   Clean data at the beginning of a project to save time in the long run.
-   Recognize the packages in the {tidyverse}.
-   Use {janitor} to semi-automate common data cleaning tasks.
-   Understand when {data.table} can make data wrangling more efficient.
-   Explore {targets} for pipeline efficiency.

## Why data carpentry? {-}

> "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."

-   Hadley Wickham became (nerd) famous largely due to his [formalization of tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10).
    -   Each variable is a column.
    -   Each observation is a row.
    -   Each type of observational unit is a table.
-   Consistent structure means downstream tools can be built to expect that structure.

## The tidyverse: Core {-}

-   {modelr}: Modelling Functions that Work with the Pipe
    -   Not covered in DSLC 2e
    -   {tidymodels}

## janitor {-}

-   clean_names()
-   remove_constant() & remove_empty()
    -   I like `quiet = FALSE`
-   tabyl()
-   others?

## data.table {-}

From DESCRIPTION:

-   Fast aggregation of large data (e.g. 100GB in RAM)
-   Fast ordered joins
-   Fast add/modify/delete of columns by group using no copies at all
-   List columns
-   Friendly and fast character-separated-value read/write
-   Offers a natural and flexible syntax, for faster development.

## targets {-}

From DESCRIPTION:

> "Pipeline tools coordinate the pieces of computationally demanding analysis projects. The 'targets' package is a 'Make'-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science in R. The package skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, orchestrates the necessary computation with implicit parallel computing, and abstracts files as R objects. If all the current output matches the current upstream code and data, then the whole pipeline is up to date, and the results are more trustworthy than otherwise. The methodology in this package borrows from GNU 'Make' (2015, ISBN:978-9881443519) and 'drake' (2018, <doi:10.21105/joss.00550>)."

-   *Ie,* only run the things that have changed.
-   Also see {tarchetypes} to make {targets} easier to use.

00:04:18	Gus Lipkin:	https://atrebas.github.io/post/2019-03-03-datatable-dplyr/
00:09:07	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	start
00:11:46	Gus Lipkin:	I misread that as “nerd” modifying “Hadley Wickham” and not “famous” at first 😂
00:20:50	Gus Lipkin:	There’s also tidytable (https://markfairbanks.github.io/tidytable/)

Some people strongly prefer one over the other.
00:22:18	Gus Lipkin:	“To use dtplyr, you must at least load dtplyr and dplyr. You may also want to load data.table so you can access the other goodies that it provides:”

“But generally you should reserve this only for debugging, and use as.data.table(), as.data.frame(), or as_tibble() to indicate that you’re done with the transformation and want to access the results:”
00:23:48	Gus Lipkin:	“reserve this only for debugging” refers to not casting as suggested
```
