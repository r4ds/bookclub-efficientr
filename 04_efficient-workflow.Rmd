# Efficient workflow

**Learning objectives:**

When we finish this chapter, we will be able to:

- Sketch an initial workflow for our projects.
- Identify workflow software tools both inside and outside R.
- Divide the work into chunks to better delineate what needs to get done.
- Improve documentation and reproducibility of projects.

## Top tips for efficient workflow {-}

- Start with pen and paper to sketch overall workflow.
- Make a plan for how to get things done, dividing the work into chunks.
- Select packages early to boost efficiency once coding begins.
- Document early and thoroughly.
- Emphasize reproducibility. knitr recommended as a handy tool for this

*These tips apply to different project scopes, but may be implemented differently depending on needs.*

## Tip 1: Start with pen and paper {-}

*"Smart preparation minimizes work"*

Before starting a project, understanding the scope and generating a plan helps smooth workflow.

**Technical debt:** Lack of planning can lead to code slop that will slow us down in the long run.

Division of labor and consideration of the scale/scope of a project.

- Who will work on the project?
- What management tools will be needed? GitHub, Jira, Trello, etc.
- What's the timescale, and what is reasonable within that timescale?

## Tip 2: Chunk the work {-}

Think through the phases of work, and try to estimate the demands and timescale of each phase.

Using SMART chunks to ensure things are broken up in ways that are useful:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Realistic
- Time-bound

Variety of R packages that can help with this:

- plan
- plotrix
- DiagrammeR

## Tip 3: Package selection {-}

*"R is notorious for allowing users to solve problems in many ways."*

Often someone else has solved problems you're going to approach. No need to reinvent the wheel!

Effective package selection at the outset helps establish your workflow and constrain your solution space.

Also useful emphasis on package intercompatibility -- e.g. working within the tidyverse.

Lots of packages available. *How do people choose the right ones?*

## Tip 4: Document throughout {-}

Keep code well commented for others and for yourself.

R Markdown framework super helpful for this. Using the options within the code chunks (eval and echo) thoughtfully to boost documentation.

## Tip 5: Publishing with reproducibility {-}

Dynamic document preparation within R (e.g. Rmd). Limit the need to manually copy things if there are data changes.

Cache code chunks that don't need to be re-run regularly and that are time consuming.

Consider treating a project as an R package?
