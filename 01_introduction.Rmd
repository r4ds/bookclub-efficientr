# Introduction

**Learning objectives:**

When we finish this chapter, we will be able to:

-   Predict how this book will be **useful for us.**
-   Compare and contrast **algorithmic efficiency** and **programmer productivity.**
-   Explain why **efficiency of R programming** might be different from **efficiency in other programming languages.**
-   Describe **why efficiency is important.**
-   Explore **general skills** to improve efficiency.
-   Use **benchmarking** to measure code speed.
-   Use **profiling** to locate slow code.

## Who is this for? {.unnumbered}

Answer: Everybody!

-   ‚¨ÜÔ∏è programming xp / ‚¨áÔ∏è R xp: avoid R pitfalls
-   ‚¨áÔ∏è programming xp / ‚¨ÜÔ∏è R xp: tricks from CS
-   ‚¨áÔ∏è programming xp / ‚¨áÔ∏è R xp: develop good habits
-   ‚¨ÜÔ∏è programming xp / ‚¨ÜÔ∏è R xp: we are smarter than me!

## Who are we? {.unnumbered}

**Let's get to know one another!**

1.  What's your **name** & **location?**
2.  How many **R4DS book clubs** have you participated in?
3.  How much **experience** do you have **with R?** How do you use it?
4.  How much **programming experience** do you have outside R (if any)?

## Types of efficiency {.unnumbered}

-   **Algorithmic efficiency:** How quickly the computer can run code.
-   **Programmer productivity:** How quickly the person can get things done.

## Why is R different? {.unnumbered}

-   **Lots of ways to do everything.**
-   **R isn't compiled**, but **wraps compiled code.**
-   R is mostly **functional,** but can also be **object-oriented.**
-   R runs in **RAM** (vs on disk).
-   R has great **IDEs.**
    -   RStudio? VSCode? Other?
-   R has the **best community.**

## Why efficiency? {.unnumbered}

-   Algorithmic efficiency: **Less waiting** for the computer.
-   Programmer productivity: **Try more** things / try things faster.

## General efficiency skills {.unnumbered}

-   **Touch typing:** Do you?
-   **Consistent styles**
    -   **packageName**
    -   `function()`
    -   `object`
    -   `fully::qualified()`

## Benchmarking {.unnumbered}

-   Most useful to **compare approaches.**
-   They recommend **microbenchmark**.
-   **bench** is a newer alternative.
    -   \~Prettier.
    -   Includes RAM.
    -   More dependencies.

## Benchmarking: microbenchmark {.unnumbered}

```{r 01-benchmarking-microbenchmark}
df <- data.frame(v = 1:4, name = letters[1:4])

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(df[3, 2], df[3, "name"], df$name[3])
```

## Benchmarking: bench {.unnumbered}

```{r 01-benchmarking-bench}
df <- data.frame(v = 1:4, name = letters[1:4])

bench::mark(df[3, 2], df[3, "name"], df$name[3])
```

Other variables: `n_itr`, `n_gc`, `total_time`, `result`, `memory`, `time`, `gc`

## Profiling {.unnumbered}

-   **profvis**
-   Avoid **optimizing the wrong thing.**
    -   Improve programmer productivity at improving algorithmic efficiency.

![](images/f1_2_profvis-ice.png){alt="profvis output. The expression is broken down into steps, with time and percentage of total time for each step. The code steps are: 1. library('rnoaa'), 800 ms, 52%; 2. library('ggplot2'), 30 ms, 2%; 3. out" width="100%"}

```         
00:28:13	Keuntae_Kim:	KNIME
00:38:26	Keuntae_Kim:	Maybe Eclipse? I do not use it, I heard that someone from CS uses it.
00:39:00	Keuntae_Kim:	No Python community for study group!
00:44:29	Priyanka:	There‚Äôs a super active python community in Boston at least.
00:44:38	Priyanka:	And a few PyLadies groups too
00:45:56	Keuntae_Kim:	Got it! I did not have a chance to join those communities because I studied Python by myself. Maybe worthwhile to check out Python communities then!
00:46:09	Priyanka:	Reacted to "Got it! I did not ha..." with üëç
00:46:39	Priyanka:	Replying to "Got it! I did not ha..."

For python, I think VSCode works well( only heard so), then there is PyCharm and Spider.
00:46:47	Priyanka:	Replying to "Got it! I did not ha..."

For IDE
00:47:21	Priyanka:	Replying to "Got it! I did not ha..."

And now RStudio is getting more and more Python ( and SQL, Julia etc.) friendly too.
00:47:53	Keuntae_Kim:	Replying to "Got it! I did not ha..."

Agree. I frequently use Jupyter Notebook because of its markdown ability.
00:48:31	Keuntae_Kim:	Replying to "Got it! I did not ha..."

Yes, there are R packages that allow us to use Python, SQL in RStudio.
00:50:29	Priyanka:	Replying to "Got it! I did not ha..."

Wow that‚Äôs interesting to know about JupyTer
00:50:38	Priyanka:	Replying to "Got it! I did not ha..."

I have tried it initially for a while
00:50:56	Priyanka:	Replying to "Got it! I did not ha..."

It was ok ok ‚Ä¶ yeah nothing beats RStudio for now
00:54:05	Keuntae_Kim:	Bye!
