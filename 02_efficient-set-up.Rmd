# Efficient set-up

**Learning objectives:**

When we finish this chapter, we will be able to:

-   Use system monitoring to identify bottlenecks in our hardware/code.
-   Keep our R installation and packages up-to-date.
-   Make use of RStudioâ€™s powerful autocompletion capabilities and shortcuts.
-   Modify `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron`.
-   Use BLAS (?) if our R number crunching is too slow.


## System monitoring {-}

-   Identify if your code is memory-limited or processor-limited.
-   Makes me want to work on dedicated (isolated) server!
    -   (I couldn't see much of anything amid other noise in graphical view)
    -   (this parallel code isn't parallel on Win)

```{r 02-system, eval = FALSE}
# 1: Create large dataset
X <- as.data.frame(matrix(rnorm(1e8), nrow = 1e7))
# 2: Find the median of each column using a single core
r1 <- lapply(X, median)
# 3: Find the median of each column using many cores
r2 <- parallel::mclapply(X, median)
```


## Updating R & Packages {-}

-   {installr} to easily update on Windows
-   Good practice: load packages at top of script
-   Add `update.packages(ask = FALSE)` to `.Rprofile`???


## R Startup {-}

-   Command line: `--no-environ`, `--no-init`, `--no-restore`, `--no-save` (or `--vanilla` for all) to speed up startup
-   `.Renviron`: set environment variables
-   `.Rprofile`: run R code
-   `usethis::edit_r_environ()` & `usethis::edit_r_profile()`
-   [What They Forgot to Teach You About R Book Club](dslc.io/rwtf)
-   `options(continue = "  ")` is new to me!
-   `.Last()` runs at *end* of session


## RStudio Setup {-}

-   `usethis::use_blank_slate()` to auto-set useful options
-   `Ctrl-Alt+B`: Run to current line
-   Use projects


## WTF is BLAS? {-}

-   Basic Linear Algebra System
-   Potentially way faster for matrix math
-   Installation was beyond me ("just" follow these dozens of steps!)


## Other R Intepreters {-}

-   Microsoft R Open: [Dead](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/microsoft-r-application-network-retirement/ba-p/3707161)
-   Rho: [Dead](https://github.com/rho-devel/rho#development-on-rho-has-been-suspended-indefinitely)
-   pqR: [No updates since 2020-07-23](http://www.pqr-project.org/)
-   Renjin: [Maybe not dead??](https://github.com/Alipsa/ride)
-   webR: [The new cool thing!!!](https://webrider.rud.is/)
